#### Prepare for exercises - install Virtual Box and OP5 Monitor VM ####

Install VirtualBox for demo purposes: https://www.virtualbox.org/
Download the latest OP5 Monitor Virtual Appliance here: https://www.op5.com/op5-monitor/download-library/
After starting your Virtual Appliance, login to terminal with root:monitor
For ease of use you should also consider using Putty or Terminal (mac) to ssh into the machine

#### Getting comfortable with OP5 Monitor UI ####
 
---- Do this 2-3 times to remember (host will show):
Find the Advanced button for hosts / services configuration:
1. Monitor Hosts > Host, ALL HOSTS, configure (wrench)
 
2. Select "services for host", choose service (long dropdown box second row).
(aka LONG BAR WITH NO TITLE)
 
3. Look for the middle bar middle bar, advanced, propagate, copy etc. (you will use this!!)
 
4. Submit changes - NOTE: "see changes in nacoma" (means "submit final save")
 
5. Explore Manage > Configure "Save" (upper right), unsaved changes are indicated by yellow and a number
 
3. Right-click host icons to see extended menu.
 
 
Make changes to config item, submit and save
1. Monitor Hosts > Host, configure, check_command_args
----
 
Remove columns from host list views in Dashboards
- https://kb.op5.com/display/GUI/Customizing+listview+columns
 
Exploring dashboards: https://kb.op5.com/display/DOC/Tactical+overview
 
Add a Big number widget:
Right side dashboard > Add widget > Select widget > Position widget
 
Exploring filters: https://kb.op5.com/display/DOC/Filters
 
Try yourself, experiment with filtering only a specific service with state 1 or 2.
 
Save a filter:
Monitor > Hosts | Services > filter (small icon upper right), save
 
Find your filter:
(for removing) Manage > Manage Filters
(for using) Manage > Hosts | Services > Dropdown
 
Use your filter to populate a widget on the dashboard:
Big Numbers (click little gear in upper right, use your filter to populate)
Try List View (click little gear in upper right, use your filter query to populate)
 
Now within your listview remove some columns: https://kb.op5.com/display/GUI/Custom+columns+language+reference
 
Try limiting your default listview columns:
List columns: https://kb.op5.com/display/GUI/Listview+filter+columns
 
 
 
#### Hosts and Service ####
 
Monitor will be your go to for navigating to hosts, services, hostgroups or servicegroups
 
Try finding the "monitor" server in hosts.
 
Try finding the "updates" service under the "monitor" server.
 
Try finding the "linux" hostgroup in hostgroups, which server is found there?
 
How can you remove a service? (what must you do after removing?)
 
 
 
#### Users & Permissions ####
 
To introduce users let's first explore how permissions are defined.
 
1. Create a group
Manage > Configure > Local Users (create one, with the Default auth module and in admins group)
 
2. Now let's create a Auth Group
Manage > Configure > Local Users (create one, with the Default auth module and in admins group)
 
3. Go back to Local Users and move them to your new group.
 
*Remember Manage > Configure > Save*
 
Test logging in as your users. Do you have access to the areas you allowed?
 
4. Try limiting the menu for this new group
 
Upper right mouse over your name > Click "My Account", next to Settings click > Edit user menu
 
** DO NOT LIMIT YOUR ADMINS GROUP **
 
5. Now create a special user with access only to specific hosts:
 
https://kb.op5.com/display/HOWTOs/How+to+add+a+user+with+limited+visibility
 
 
 
#### Performance Graphs ####
 
Add a dummy service to graph:
https://kb.op5.com/display/HOWTOs/Add+new+templates+to+op5+Monitor+performance+graphs
 
 
 
#### Plugins & Commands ####
Plugins make commands possible. Commands shorten what you must configure in the "check_commands" settings.
 
1. Go to > Manage > Commands and find an existing command. Use the little search box to locate check_snmp or check_json
2. Click the syntax help, you'll find that useful in a few places.
3. You define arguments by $ARG1 $ARG2 and so on, but what does this mean?
 
HINT: $ARG$ is the argument variable you will assign a value to within the check_command field (next step)
 
Review the check_command for an existing check on the monitor server:
 
1. Search upper right for monitor, click the wrench next to the service name (not host name).
2. Show Advanced (for good practice)
3. Find check_command_args section.
4. Try adding a ! after the last item and then "test this check" what do you find?
5. What does the ! mean?
 
HINT:$ARG$ separates arguments
 
Try adding an existing check_command to monitor:
 
1. Manage > Hosts > select wrench next to hostname.
2. Click link for services.
3. Choose "check_dummy" from check command list.
4. Submit changes.
5. Update check_command_args with 0!0!0
6. Run "Test this check", what happens?
7. Change the first 0 to 1, test again, what happens?
7. Change the first 1 to 2, test again, what happens?
 
---- Adding your first plugin

Some ideas:
 
Get and report on random number, https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/
Get some weather info, https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
Get something within your domain and measure it.
 
 
 
### Alerts to slack channel ###
Ask to be added to the demo-slack channel for training (or create your own)

1. Create your webhook in slack

Name your app: name-op5-webhook
From Development Slack Workspace select: jon-op5-demo (or your own)
During setup "Post to" use "general"
Please go to: https://kb.op5.com/display/HOWTOs/How+to+Integrate+OP5+with+Slack

2. Create a service check within "Monitor"
Name it "slack_test"
Use "dummy_check" check_command which should be pre-installed
For command_args: 0
Set check interval to 1
Set max_check_attempts to 1
Turn off active_checks
Click the "test" button to verify the status is "OK"
Save your configuration (Submit changes at bottom of page, use upper right button "Save" to commit changes)

3. Test notification
For active checks you might use "Check Now", we will use Submit Passive Check to test
To quickly get back to your service use upper right, hover over the question mark to get shortcut search ideas
Search slack_test
Click on the service Name
From right menu Options > Actions > Submit Passive Check
Choose "Critical" use the "Plugin output" to pass any message. Try: 0!You Name!Some message
 
 
 
#### HTTP API, with examples ####
 
See your API documentation at: https://your-op5-hostname/api
 
Test each of these examples (Python, or use as examples in language of your choice):
https://github.com/joncav/op5-api-examples/blob/master/hosts-services-manage.py
 
Create a service for passive check results:
 
1. Monitor > Hosts > Configure
2. Select "services for host"
3. Add name of service.
4. Submit and save.
 
Try this: https://kb.op5.com/display/HOWTOs/Submitting+status+updates+through+the+HTTP+API
 
 
 
#### Event Handlers ####
http://www.it-slav.net/blogs/2009/06/15/using-nagios-or-op5-monitor-eventhandler-to-start-a-service-that-has-stopped/
 
Use this example, selecting a service that is running on your monitor server.
